This is a simple playground application for me to try different technologies in.

## Stack

Currently, it uses the following stack:

- Golang
- HTMX
- MongoDB

## Get started

### Installation

This project is for me to play with. If you want to do so to, I would suggest
forking the project.

### Usage

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Go
- MongoDB

You can get started with the following steps:

- Run a mongoDB instance (preferably in docker)
- Update the .env file with you mongoDB connection URI
- In the root of the project, run

```sh
go run main.go
```

Alternatively you can install air and simply run

```sh
air
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome through issues. I would appreciate code reviews, code
suggestions, alternative architectures and more idiomatic approaches to
different things. Since this project is primarily for me, PRs would not make a
lot of sense.
